I develop software as part of my research and as a hobby. I love working on Open Source projects. I believe that science must be available to everyone!

Below you'll find packages/software/scripts that I developed during my Ph.D.

pymfe: Python Meta-Feature Extractor
------------------------------------
The pymfe (**py**thon **m**eta-**f**eature **e**xtractor) provides a
comprehensive set of meta-features implemented in python. The package brings
cutting edge meta-features, following recent literature propose. The pymfe
architecture was thought to systematically make the extraction, which can
produce a robust set of meta-features. Moreover, pymfe follows recent
meta-feature formalization aiming to make MtL reproducible.

The installation process is similar to other packages available on pip:

```python
pip install -U pymfe
```

We write a great [Documentation](https://pymfe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
to guide you on how to use the pymfe library.
